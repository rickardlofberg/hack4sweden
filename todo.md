# To do list

- Update examples
- Integrate ontology to interface
- Integrate meetup api to interface
- Add Flask application for local testing
- Break out "convert requested data to json check" to own function/method? (done?)
- Better solution to go from listed jobs to taxonomy jobs.
- How can we find the best match in taxonomy when going from the ontology match?
