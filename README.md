 “Breaching the gap between newcomers and the job market by providing networking and job forecast.”
 
A third of newcomers have an education equal to or higher than gymnasiet (have an easier time finding a job), another third has grundskolan. Today it takes ~5 years to get a job, for newcomers. 16% women and 36% men are employed after ended etableringsprogram. (This means there’s potential in focusing on how to reach women specifically as they often are caretakers for several people i.e. their employment makes a big impact).
Club activities like sports or other volunteering supports building social networks, that can lead to finding relevant contacts within a one’s field of work. It also helps developing language skills. So, not only is properly guided job seeking important but so is associative time, where networking can enable connecting with the right people. This can increase better matchmaking between job and skills (decrease overqualification).
